        <h4>About Apex Cycling</h4>
        <hr/>
        <p>Established in 1995 as a fickle 8-bit e-commerce store selling 8-bit bicycles, with our server set up in a shed at the back of one of our houses sending a dazzling 0.08Mbps, 
            it would be fair to say we have come a long way.</p>
        <p>Now Ireland's leading supplier of cycling equipment, you won't fine a better bunch than this bunch!<br/>
           We like to emply local people in local communities, and we keep our tax base local (We're looking at you Bono).
        </p>
        <p>From bicycles to shorts and gears to the little rivets that hold your chain together, we're sure to have it!
            <br/>
